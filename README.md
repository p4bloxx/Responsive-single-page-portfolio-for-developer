## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge was useful firstly as a layout exercise, having different sections in which to test yourself and secondly, regarding the implementation of the contact form, managing the various inputs combined with error management.
Precisely for this last aspect, it helped me a lot to better understand how the forms work, also useful for future cases.

### Continued development

This challenge, together with the others created so far, has certainly helped me in the continuous training and implementation of Javascript concepts, so I will continue along this line to level up and then implement future libraries.

## Acknowledgments

In this case, during the implementation of the form and the writing of Javascript to cover all the required functionality, it was useful for me to consult external resources, one in particular present on https://stackoverflow.com/ because initially, the code that I wanted to write, although it would have worked, it seemed a little too long, and I was sure that there would be a more effective method to handle the problem.
This gave me a chance to understand how to manage in the future, some features that I had to perform in this challenge.
